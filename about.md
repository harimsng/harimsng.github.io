### Summary
<hr style="border: none; border-bottom: 1px solid white;">
I am software engineer with a strong interest in low-level areas such as embedded softwares and operating systems. Writing and debugging such things is challenging but gives rewarding experience.

### Skills
<hr style="border: none; border-bottom: 1px solid white;">
C/C++, shell script, Makefile, git, Docker, x86 


### Projects
<hr style="border: none; border-bottom: 1px solid white;">

##### Unix Shell
- Implemented a subset of the POSIX shell.
- Handwrote a recursive descent parser for better readability and flexibility compared to other methods.
- Debugged syntax by printing out the syntax structure.
- Conducted module and integration testing using shell script.

##### HTTP Webserver
- Implemented a web server supporting HTTP/1.1 and a subset of the nginx configuration.
- Optimized the HTTP message processing pipeline to minimize memory footprint. Upon receiving an HTTP message, the body is sent to the destination immediately. Performance gain is significant, especially when the message body is large, compared to waiting until the entire message is fully received.

##### Wireframe Renderer


### Education
<hr style="border: none; border-bottom: 1px solid white;">
##### 42 Seoul, Member

- Peer evaluation system


##### Bachelor's in Physics, Seongkyunkwan University (SKKU)
2025\. 2

### Experience
<hr style="border: none; border-bottom: 1px solid white;">

##### SKKU High Energy Nuclear Physics Lab, Intern
2024\. 2 - 2025. 1

- Automated simulation configuration, job batching and data processing using shell script.
- Provided debugging support for C++, ROOT, and research tool build errors for students.


### Achievements
<hr style="border: none; border-bottom: 1px solid white;">
##### SKKU Next-generation Automotive Network SW Team Competition, 3rd place
2025\. 2

- Assembled hardware for zonal architecture in small scale using a HPC, 3 ZCUs, 3 Arduinos and 12 ultrasonic sensors.
- Gained experience with network layer, Ethernet for HPC and ZCU communication, and CAN for ZCU and Arduino communication.
- Developed a FreeRTOS task for parking logic running on HPC (RA6M3 MCU).
- Reduced the time interval for the task to calculate an average of 20 consecutive values from an ultrasonic sensor within a shorter time frame. This was necessary to mitigate severe fluctuations in detected distances.
